# Social Network in C++

A simple console-based Social Network application developed in C++.

## Features

- Add and manage users  
- Send, accept, and reject friend requests  
- Block and unblock users  
- Display friend lists and search friends by name (using KMP algorithm)  
- Suggest friends based on mutual connections (using BFS)  

## Description

This project simulates a basic social networking system with core features such as managing users, friendships, friend requests, blocking, and friend suggestions.  
It uses efficient data structures like graphs, hash maps, and algorithms including BFS and KMP for search functionality.


## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed.
2. Compile the program using the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 social_network.cpp -o social_network
